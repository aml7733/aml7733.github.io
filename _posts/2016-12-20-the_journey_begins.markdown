Why did I want to learn code?  That's an easy question with a long answer. It's fun, it's the future, and my other education wasn't getting me anywhere.


##It's fun:
Really, I promise.  If you haven't tried it, try it.  There are tons of coding games and apps out there for free.  It's like a bunch of successive logic puzzles, and at the end of the grinding is the coolest prize of all.  You just made something from nothing.  I'm sure it's similar to (can't say the same - don't want to upset anybody) the sense of accomplishment that an painter or photographer gets when they capture something perfectly.  That idea in your head, it's now a thing.  And it works, finally!

It also happens to come naturally to me.  I've always been the kinda guy who wants to know how things work.  With the way I can literally see, step by step, exactly what is happening - it turns out I really enjoy debugging.  Which is best-case-scenario, I'm told by everybody in the tech field.  "99% of the time, you'll be dealing with broken code" they say.  When you don't mind digging, mining is easy peasy.


##It's the future:
I literally can't think of an industry that won't need programmers eventually.  Everyone that's trying to sell something needs a website.  Smartphone usage has skyrocketed.  It's a valuable skill for the labor force and it's a desired skill in higher paying positions.  We're headed toward automation in transportation, manufacturing, mining, and somebody's got to program those robots.  And the databases.  And the websites.  


##Wasn't getting anywhere
Backstory time, I guess.  The polite way to put it would be, I think, considering myself a "Jack of All Trades."  In a more 'classical' sense, I've never had a job longer than a year and a half.  And my favorite job only lasted 4 months (always contract things, I've never been fired).  

I've worked on painting crews, construction crews, NASA's small business crew, a couple consulting firms, research firms, and, of course, restaurants.  I can make you arrancini, run the books for the restaurant, repair the drywall, build a bar area, paint it professionally, audit myself (if only that were legal...), rent out the room upstairs, and then write a paper on the economic ramifications of Zimbabwe's looming hyperinflation and teach your kids SAT prep, and I would have professional or educational experience in every one of those tasks.

Ok, those last two kinda fell off the rails there, but I wanted to squeeze them in.  The problem is, since graduating from The George Washington University in 2011 with my shiny new Bachelor of Science degree in Economice, I've been employed at a restaurant as often as not.  Thought it was time for a change, and here we are.  

##Where I'm going
Well, sky's the limit, I suppose.  I looked up programming bootcamps and found Flatiron School's online web dev program.  Working through now, (only just noticed blog posts were supposed to be assigned weekly, so please forgive the catch-up period).  I'm hoping to finish quickly, and up and move across the country.  I figure a career change is the best time to move, and without an impetus, people generally stay put.  This feels like my chance to set myself where I decide, rather than just accepting where I was put.  Wish me luck.
