Man alive, it's so much better having a job than looking for a job.  I have disposable income, benefits, nice coworkers, a transportation subsidy, a modest christmas bonus.  Not much to not like. I'm using a tech stack that has a Java back end, and uses Ruby on Rails and React as the front end.  Wish I had some Java knowledge, but I'm getting by focusing on front-end stories mostly.
